Yes, there is a fixed formula for CGPA to percentage conversion at MAKAUT. It's pretty simple and you can use it even if you are not very good at Math. The formula is Percentage=(CGPA - 0.75)*10 

let us understand this through an example. If you have a CGPA of 8.25 then your percentage would be : (8.25 - 0.75)*10 

Calculating the above expression, the percentage is equal to 75%. This formula is applicable to every CGPA even 10. A 10 CGPA will be around 92.5 %. The university through its official website has released the following details to make things simpler.
